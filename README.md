# Devin's School Notes
## literally devin's school notes 
This is a new project im trying out. In a nutshell, I will write my notes in the Markdown format. Then, I will publish this to GitHub. Because my notes are hosted on GitHub, this lets me use `git clone` to download my notes to a new computer, and `git commit` to upload new notes on GitHub. 

I will either use vim, VS Code, or the GNOME Text editor to write my notes. I might also use VS Code's built in Git and GitHub integration, or I might just use the command line version of Git. All of the notes are organized from `grade/class/`, and then it will be activity or topic specific. 

This collection has the notes from the following grades:

- Grade 8

I don't really know why you need my notes, but here you go
