# devin's school notes
## literally devin's school notes 
this is a new project im trying out. in a nutshell, i'll write my notes in the markdown format. then, i'll publish this to Github. because my notes are hosted on GitHub, this lets me use `git clone` to download my notes to a new computer, and `git commit` to upload new notes on GitHub. 

i'll probably use vim, VS Code, or the GNOME Text editor to write my notes. i might also use VS Code's built in Git and GitHub integration, or i might just use the command line version of Git. all of the notes are organized from `grade/class/`, and then it will be activity or topic specific. 

this is a work in progress, and i'm not sure when i'll be done

this collection has the notes from the following grades:

- grade 8

i don't really know why you need my notes, but here you go!
