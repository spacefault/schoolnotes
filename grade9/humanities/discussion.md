### What makes something an Issue?
It's usually a topic that has a wide range of responses, and it has a general net impact on a lot of people. It's usually a framed and unbiased question, and can be solved with one clear (right or wrong!) answer.

It usually requires:
- an informed response supported by clear and relevant reasons
- critical thinking about worldview
- multiple perspectives must be taken into consideration
- background knowledge and research
### What are some issues in Canadian Politics?
- Housing Crisis
- Homelessness
- Employment crisis
- the world is literally ending here
- Inflation & Economy
- Climate Change crisis
- Social Issues
- Hate Speech 
- just a bunch of stuff tbh
- Healthcare problems

Not all issues are created equally. Some issues affect minorities, while some issues can affect a lot of Canadians.

### Why do we need to learn about our government?
"We cannot work or eat or drink; we cannot buy or sell or own anything; we cannot go to a ball game or a hockey game or watch TV without feeling the effects of government. We cannot marry or educate our children, cannot be sick, born or buried without the hand of government somewhere intervening." - Senator Eugene Forsey

The government plays and integral role in our lives. The government's influence plays a part in our choices and safety. If we learn about the government, we can understand the roles it plays and know our rights.
