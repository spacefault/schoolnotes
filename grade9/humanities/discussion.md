## 2023-09-06

### What makes something an Issue?
It's usually a topic that has a wide range of responses, and it has a general net impact on a lot of people. It's usually a framed and unbiased question, and can be solved with one clear (right or wrong!) answer.

It usually requires:
- an informed response supported by clear and relevant reasons
- critical thinking about worldview
- multiple perspectives must be taken into consideration
- background knowledge and research
### What are some issues in Canadian Politics?
- Housing Crisis
- Homelessness
- Employment crisis
- the world is literally ending here
- Inflation & Economy
- Climate Change crisis
- Social Issues
- Hate Speech 
- just a bunch of stuff tbh
- Healthcare problems

Not all issues are created equally. Some issues affect minorities, while some issues can affect a lot of Canadians.

### Why do we need to learn about our government?
"We cannot work or eat or drink; we cannot buy or sell or own anything; we cannot go to a ball game or a hockey game or watch TV without feeling the effects of government. We cannot marry or educate our children, cannot be sick, born or buried without the hand of government somewhere intervening." - Senator Eugene Forsey

The government plays and integral role in our lives. The government's influence plays a part in our choices and safety. If we learn about the government, we can understand the roles it plays and know our rights. 

### What is a Government

The word "Government" originated from both Greek and Latin and means "to steer."

### Canada's Federal Political System
Even though the Prime Minister is seen as the leader of Canada, there are many layers to the government system. Mainly, there are 3 layers of government. 
The Main 3 layers are:

- Federal
- Provincial
- Municipal

These layers assure that each branch can have their own responsibility, and that they can do it well. It's like the UNIX philosophy!

#### Federal Government
The Federal Government is the highest level in the stack. It handles stuff like international relations, national defence, immigration, etc.

#### Provincial Government
The Provincial Government handles stuff like natural resources, transportation, road infrastructure, education, etc. These are usually province specific

#### Municipal Government
The Municipal Government handles inquiries related to cities, towns, and villages. They handle things like waste removal, water and sewage, libraries, etc.

### Canada's Government System
There usually is an election every 5 years to determine the PM. There's 338 people elected to form the government. It's separate pieces called constituencies or ridings.

Anyone can become a member of a party. Each party decides who will run in a constituency. People can run as independent, which means they aren't tied to a specific party. However, they'll need to pay $1000 and find enough people to sign a nomination form.

People who are voted in, become MPs, or Members of Parliament. The parliament buildings are in Canada's capital, which is Ottawa.

#### Branches of the Government
The Federal government is broken up into 3 branches. These branches are:

- Legislative, makes the laws
- Executive, (add information)
- Judicial, Enforces laws

#### Executive Branch
The Executive branch consists of the PM and the cabinet. In order to become PM, you must be elected the leader of a political party.

Secondly, you must be elected a member of the parliament, and your party must win the most seats in the House of Commons. The cabinet is compiled of people that hold responsibility.. (add more here)

The PM also decides which departments or agencies (aka portfolios), to include in the cabinet, as well as the cabinet ministers to represent them. The cabinet is the one that proposes the majority of the ideas that later become laws.

Together, the PM and the cabinet run the daily affairs of the Government.

#### Monarch of Britain
The Monarch is represented in Canada by the governor general, and is part of both the executive and legislative branches of government.

The Queen, or King, of England, is the head of state in Canada, but does not play an active role in Canada's government.

It's appointed by the Queen on the advice of Canada's Prime Minister. Major roles include signing bills, travels to other countries for relations, etc.

### Legislative Branch
(info coming soon!)

#### Cabinet Member Portfolios

### Canada's Constitution
It's the law that describes the governance process, and it sets other important institutions like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It sets soles for the three branches of government.

#### Constitution act of 1982
Formerly known as the British North America Act (BNA), it established the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also affirms the rights of the indigenous peoples of Canada, provides a basis for equalisation between the provinces, and establishes a formula for Constitutional amendments. It was made in 1867 and was renamed in 1982. (check required)
