## How effectively does Canada's federal political system govern Canada for all Canadians?

**Governments** effectively control the lives of Canadians. The Canadian government has multiple layers in it. This chapter explores the process of **governance** in Canada, which are the processes and structures that guides the governing process.

### Canada's Federal Political System
Even though the Prime Minister is seen as the leader of Canada, there are many layers to the government system. Mainly, there are 3 layers of government. 
The Main 3 layers are:

- Federal
- Provincial
- Municipal

These layers assure that each branch can have their own responsibility, and that they can do it well. It's like the UNIX philosophy!

#### Federal Government
The Federal Government is the highest level in the stack. It handles stuff like international relations, national defence, immigration, etc.

#### Provincial Government
The Provincial Government handles stuff like natural resources, transportation, road infrastructure, education, etc. These are usually province specific

#### Municipal Government
The Municipal Government handles inquiries related to cities, towns, and villages. They handle things like waste removal, water and sewage, libraries, etc.
