## 1.1 | The characteristics of Living Things

Living things need to achieve a certain criteria to be considered living. Many researchers and scientists believe that these 6 characteristics are what makes a living organism.

The characteristics are
-   it is made of cells
-   it needs energy
-   it grows and develops
-   it responds to the environment
-   it reproduces
-   has adaptations for its environment

Once a living thing has all of these characteristics, it is considered an organism. However, non living things may have some of these characteristics but an organism needs all 6 to be considered living.

### Cells
Cells are mainly considered to be the building blocks of life and other living organisms. All organisms (including humans) are made up of cells and cells are built from other cells. They are microscopic in size, however when combined they can increase in size (example: cells in a tree).

### Energy
Every action an organism does requires some form of energy. For example, in humans our “energy” is calories, and we can burn and gain calories by eating and doing exercise. When we eat, we gain nutrients that can assist in giving us energy and keeping the cells alive. Many animals and species get their energy and nutrients from nearby places. When we take these nutrients, there is a chemical process called metabolism which regulates the energy using processed and the energy creating processes.

### Responding to the Environment
Organisms respond and adapt to their nearby environments. For example, you see a car moving very fast in your direction, and so you jump out of the way. This process is called a stimulus, and it is designed to respond to certain things that trigger it.

### Growth and Development
When organisms grow, it means that there is a change in the structure of the cells in it. Sometimes, things can grow to a certain height and stop growing, like people and plants.

### Reproduction
All living things are made from other living things. The process of reproduction is not necessary, however, it is important for the survival of each type of organism.

### Adaptations
Many organisms and cells adapt to their surrounding environment. For example, In the winter, Snowshoe hares grow a white coat of fur so they can blend into the snow to hide from predators.

## 1.2 | Structure and Function

Living things need to do certain things to keep themselves alive. Some of these include gathering food and more. Organisms have developed many ways of doing these tasks, and have developed body parts, or structures to do them. Each structure is designed to be used for a specific function, which means it carries out a specific task. For example, in the sea world, many structures are being used for the underwater species to survive. The structures are:

-   Gills
-   Lungs
-   Spiracles
-   Skin

### Variations in Structure
Structures are different in many species, for example there are different bird species that do the same thing (eating seeds), but the design is different.

## 1.3 | Organs and Organ systems
Our body parts are called organs, and our bodies use each other in conjunction to keep us feeling well. This is called an organ system.

### Respiratory system
